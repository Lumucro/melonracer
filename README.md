Garry's mod melonracer gamemode proof-of-concept remake

This gamemode is currently no longer available / dead in Garry's Mod
The code present here serves as proof that it is still possible to make, and that old maps can be made compatible with some hacky but effective code

The code is undocumented but should be quite simple to understand and self-explaining
If you have any questions regarding it, feel free to contact me and I will happily explain how it works
